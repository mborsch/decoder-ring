# decoder-ring
Thinkful's decoder ring challenge. Created a caesar, polybius, and substitution cipher.
This Thinkful Capstone project utilizes javascript to create three different ciphers.
The caesar cipher shifts letters a determined number.
the polybius cipher creates a 5x5 table to map the letters and uses numbers for encryption.
the substitution cipher takes a substituted alphabet and creatred an encode message.
This project is currently not intended to be used, and was created to prove my efficacy in solving complex problems using JavaScript.
I plan to improve this app by creating a user interface and option for user's to share messages with friends.
